## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- It is a method of software design that arranges programs as a group of stand-alone services and allows for flexibility in the software department.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- There are nine characteristics of SOA which are the standard service contracts, Loose Coupling, Abstraction, Service Reusability, autonomy, statelessness, discoverability, composability, and interoperability. SOA is independent of to each other so user can developed and update services without affecting the other. 

3. Define Microservices.
- A microservice is designed to carry out a particular business function that may be implemented in a service. It also encourages flexibility in software development as many teams may work on various tasks in various services at the same time, making it simpler and quicker to create new functionality. 

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- The main benefit of using Microservices, in my opinion, is its flexibility, which lets the user select the best programming language for their needs. Since the user is already familiar with it, we can work with it easier and they will feel more at ease using their knowledge and skills. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- The similarities between microservices and service oriented architecture is that Multiple apps are able to use and utilize both microservices and service-oriented architecture's services. However,  their communication styles is different because microservices use communication protocols like HTTP/REST, while SOA uses standardized protocols like SOAP or XML-RPC.
